## 🚨 Problem Statement

In the digital age, privacy is fragile:
- Plain text is easy to intercept  
- Encrypted blobs look suspicious  
- Safe communication is often too technical

> What if your message didn’t *look* like a message at all?

---

## ✅ Solution — CryptifyLens

> AES Encrypted + 🖼️ LSB Embedded = A normal image hiding powerful secrets.

With CryptifyLens, your secrets vanish inside everyday images — no traces, no hints.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
MESSAGE → AES Encryption → Hide in Image → Share

Image → Extract + Decrypt → Secret Revealed


---
